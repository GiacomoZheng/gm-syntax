# Hotstrings

In order to write down the mathematics characters on computers, I have implemented several methods for you.

* [VS code GM snipplet](vscode-snipplet). It has already been a part of `vscode-gm` extension.
* [Replace text and punctuation in documents on Mac](text-macos). See the instruction inside (I guess it only works for Mac OS).
* [Autohotkey](autohotkey). I'm using Mac OS now, so that I may not update it for a period of time. You can still use it.

`gm.toml` is the source file of the rules of my shortcut. I use `hotstrings.py` to translate.
