# text-macos

This folder includes the `gm.plist` source file of me. For mac users, you use the functionality [Replace text and punctuation in documents on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh35735/mac) to write math characters. To use my shortcuts, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl2a7bd795/mac).

BUGS:
* it seems the macos do not differ the captial and small letters in input.
